# Play Rocket
It’s a pool toy. The buttons are for making it a challenge when you are trying to grip it in the pool. The hole inside of it helps it get air and release are to go up and down, to make it a challenge to get the toy in the pool.



My favorite part about it is the bolt. The bolt is a simple part about it. It helps it move around. It helps it go every place it would go. It helps it to dive. It helps it to come up to the surface.

And don’t forget the fins. The fins help control the play rocket.

Don't worry if you wet it. It is supposed to get wet.
